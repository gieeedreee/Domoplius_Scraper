In industry, there are other factors to consider when building machine learning models - inference time, solution complexity, maintainability and so on. However, even though you only learn a subset of the required skills while participating in Kaggle competitions, it is quite a fun way to learn by doing it, so let's participate in one of the tutorial competitions now!"
